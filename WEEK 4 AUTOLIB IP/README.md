Business Overview
Autolib Electric carshairing service is the usage of vehicles for a short-term from a designated parking station or parking spaces located across a city. Clients are normally charged either by distance or time-driven, or a mix of the two, and the cars are usually accessed with a smartphone or membership card with no need for interaction between people. This enables people to give up their cars while still having the flexibility that comes with owning one. This business model also gives households without cars better and more fair access to goods and services that would otherwise require a car.
